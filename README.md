Thank you for viewing my first project in HTML/CSS!

This project was made to demonstrate the skills I've learned so far in HTML/CSS and to fill in any gaps I might find in the process. A few of the things used in this project were:

-Use of multiple methods of incorporating CSS styles

-Use of Chrome's inspect function to modify things on the fly along with Visual Studio

-An alarming amount of padding/borders/positioning

-Using a text form and submit buttons

-Links and hover effects on links

This project was fun to work on and I have a new respect for Google's seemingly simple webpage. I especially struggled with the top and bottom links but was able to make it work after Googling the problem. *chuckles*
